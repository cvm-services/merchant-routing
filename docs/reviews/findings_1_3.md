# Findings 1–3 Review: routstr_delist — thirty-first independent offload pass

Scope (per the original task): finding 1 safety (delisting the routstr SALE must
never disable the routstr provider or touch the T470 flat-router ladder),
finding 2 post-delisting confirmation via an independent re-fetch, finding 3
fail-safe behaviour on an absent / garbage / stale `--preds` monitor feed.

**Artifact-path status (required immediate report).** The task names three
artifacts. `~/.hermes/bot/scripts/routstr_delist.py` (829 lines, md5
`2ea724ef08d857cd…`) and `~/.hermes/bot/tests/test_routstr_delist.py` (752 lines,
md5 `031851b356f0de40…`) are present and byte-identical to repo
`src/routstr_delist.py` and `tests/test_routstr_delist_contract.py`
respectively (measured this pass with `md5sum` on both pairs — both digests
match). **`~/.hermes/bot/docs/routstr_delist_contract.md` is MISSING — HIGH.**
`~/.hermes/bot/docs/` holds only `routstr-delist.md` (197 lines, md5
`e385af98b9c142ee…`, byte-identical to repo `docs/routstr-delist.md`) and
`reviews/`; the contract role is filled by that stand-in doc, read end-to-end
this pass. Re-measured this pass: `ls` of the path returns
`No such file or directory`, and a targeted `find ~/.hermes/bot -iname
'*contract*'` returned no hits before exceeding the tool timeout (the sweep
timed out on the 19 G `bot` tree; the direct `ls` is the decisive measurement).
This is an artifact-provisioning defect, deliberately reported here in the
preamble and **not** promoted into one of the three findings — it is not a
defect in the script or its tests.

**Duplicate-dispatch disclosure.** This card (`worker-base/F45-review-16`) has
been re-dispatched many times; the deliverable already exists at
`docs/reviews/findings_1_3.md` (creating commit `11e40f9`, `git log
--diff-filter=A`) and is committed-clean. `git log --oneline -- <path> | wc -l`
→ **49** touches. Its own convention — and this card's acceptance criterion — is
exactly three `## Finding` sections (`grep -c '^## '` → 3, measured this pass),
so every prior pass **rewrote** the file in place rather than appending a §N
section. This pass does the same: it re-derives the three findings from the
current artifacts, whose md5s were measured unchanged this pass (`2ea724ef…`,
`031851b356…`, `e385af98…` — not assumed). Ordinal convention: the immediately
prior revision titled itself the *thirtieth* independent offload pass and
committed as `8d12776`; this pass is therefore the **thirty-first** by that (the
file's own preamble) convention. The pre-write baseline this pass replaces is
that 30th blob: `git show 8d12776:docs/reviews/findings_1_3.md | md5sum` →
`bc2e4b295a7b2c40…`, byte-equal to the working file before the rewrite (measured,
not carried from the 30th pass's prose). **Result of the re-derivation: the
finding vector is unchanged.** All 122 `A:` citation checks pass byte-exactly
against the live blobs (every `path:N` reference in the three finding bodies
below). No severity moved: F1 **OK** with LOW ×3; F2 **OK** with a MEDIUM ×1 +
LOW ×2; F3 **OK** with a MEDIUM ×1 + LOW ×4. Artifacts untouched.

Citation legend: `routstr_delist.py:N` = the script (both copies, byte-identical);
`contract:N` = repo `tests/test_routstr_delist_contract.py` (the 25-case
deployed suite, byte-identical to `~/.hermes/bot/tests/test_routstr_delist.py`);
`tests:N` = repo `tests/test_routstr_delist.py` (the 96-case main suite);
`docs:N` = `docs/routstr-delist.md`.

Verification performed this pass (all hermetic; scratch off `/tmp`): the script,
both suites and the stand-in doc read end-to-end; a fresh probe for this pass,
`docs/reviews/routstr_f13_probes/probe_f13_pass31.py` (written this pass; the A
citation audit re-asserts each cited line by substring, and B/C/D/E re-execute
the module's real payloads and CLI paths against hermetic fakes),
exercising **196 checks** (A citation audit ×122, B safety ×30, C confirmation
×16, D fail-safe ×26, E review-record integrity ×2), executed **twice with
byte-identical transcript sha256
`413e1869d452cb4b36db5d8a6afc315ae7568f5cbecc8efb17e1e56484ed00b1` → 196/196
PASS**, zero FAIL lines. Two false-FAIL probe bugs were found and fixed during
authoring (both probe defects, artifact correct): a docs:54 needle that included
backticks the line does not carry, and a stale `FakeBackend.verify_res`
(`count==3` left over from the lying-pull case) that made two later
override/unscoped runs report `delist_failed` instead of firing — the first run
read `192/196` and both FAILs were the probe's, not the artifact's. The repo
main suite run alone (this host's `os.fsync` can stall, so the suite was not
run beside the contract suite) → `python3 -m pytest tests/test_routstr_delist.py
-q` → **96 passed**; the repo contract suite `python3 -m pytest
tests/test_routstr_delist_contract.py -q` → **25 passed** (byte-identical to the
deployed bot copy, so the repo total is 96 + 25 = **121 passed**); all runs with
`TMPDIR` off this host's `/tmp` tmpfs (44 % used this pass).

**Disclosed probe deviations (artifact correct in every case).** Section B
re-executes the module's real payload builders against a live two-table SQLite
node and reads the *emitted* strings, rather than walking `ast.Constant` nodes:
the mutating `UPDATE`s live inside f-strings (`ast.JoinedStr`), which a
constant-only walk cannot see — an AST walk of that shape would silently
undercount the mutation surface. Section C drives `main()` through a
`FakeBackend` substituted for `rd._SshBackend` and records the *kinds* of
round-trips (pull / verify / relist); Section D's `--dry-run` / staleness drives
replace `rd.time` and `rd._SshBackend` with a fake clock and a payload-executing
fake backend so the durable-state assertions observe real `save_state`/
`load_state` behaviour without ssh; `os.fsync` is monkeypatched to a no-op for
the duration of the probe (the ATOMICITY the suite guards is the tmp +
`os.replace` protocol, which stays real).

---

## Finding 1 — Safety: SALE-delisting never disables the routstr provider or touches the T470 ladder

severity: **OK** (gaps: **LOW** ×3)

Every write path the module can take was re-enumerated from source and from
executed payloads this pass:

- **Remote DB — only the `models` (advertisement) table is mutated.** Exactly
  three UPDATE statements exist, all models-only: `routstr_delist.py:355`
  (`UPDATE models SET enabled=0 WHERE enabled=1`), `routstr_delist.py:361`
  (blanket `UPDATE models SET enabled=1`, legacy fallback), `routstr_delist.py:394`
  (parameterized `UPDATE models SET enabled=1 WHERE name IN (?,…)`). Two SELECTs
  exist (`routstr_delist.py:371` advertised-name capture,
  `routstr_delist.py:408` verify COUNT). Probes
  B:pull-names-models / B:pull-no-providers / B:relist-blanket-names-models /
  B:relist-scoped-names-models / B:verify-read-only / B:pull-one-update /
  B:relist-scoped-one-update / B:relist-blanket-one-update: every built payload
  names `models`, none names `upstream_providers`, and no payload contains
  INSERT/DELETE/DROP/ALTER/REPLACE (the verify payload is UPDATE-free).
- **`upstream_providers` / T470 ladder — docstring mentions only.** The string
  occurs exactly three times in the source (`routstr_delist.py:35`,
  `routstr_delist.py:352`, `routstr_delist.py:771`), all inside docstrings
  asserting it is NOT touched (probe B:upstream-mentions-exactly-3: measured
  line set `[35, 352, 771]`); zero executable references.
- **The remote command is one shlex-quoted argv element.** `build_ssh_docker_cmd`
  (`routstr_delist.py:414-425`) quotes the container (`routstr_delist.py:423`)
  and the payload (`routstr_delist.py:424`) and returns
  `["ssh", ssh_target, remote]` (`routstr_delist.py:425`). Probes
  B:ssh-argv-len3 / B:ssh-argv0-1 / B:ssh-remote-decompose /
  B:hostile-round-trips: the argv is 3 elements and `shlex.split(cmd[2])`
  round-trips to `docker exec <container> python3 -c <payload>` intact even with
  a hostile container name (`evil'; rm -rf / #`), and that name survives as
  exactly one remote token absent from argv[0]/argv[1]. No local shell is
  involved; only two `subprocess.run` sites exist (`routstr_delist.py:459` nak
  publish, `routstr_delist.py:808` ssh), `shell=True` occurs nowhere (probes
  B:subprocess-run-2-sites / B:no-shell-true), and the regression is pinned by
  `tests:345` (`test_ssh_cmd_is_single_shlex_safe_remote_command`).
- **Blanket relist is refused by default.** With no captured names, `--relist`
  refuses before any remote call (`routstr_delist.py:600`, `relist_refused` at
  `routstr_delist.py:606`, rc 1 at
  `routstr_delist.py:611`). The blanket SQL is reachable
  only via the explicit `--relist-any` opt-in, pinned `tests:1039` +
  `tests:1056`.
- **The ladder guard is TESTED semantically, not by substring alone.**
  `contract:468` (`TestSemanticGuardLadderUntouched`) builds a real ladder
  artifact (`contract:108`) alongside a live `upstream_providers` table
  (`contract:129`), reads provider rows from `contract:160`, executes the
  script's real payloads against it, and asserts the ladder file is
  byte-identical (`contract:480`), the provider rows are unchanged, the routstr
  provider is still an enabled candidate, and that no executed payload even
  names the table (`contract:483`). The scoped-relist direction re-asserts ladder
  byte-identity (`contract:504`) and that operator-disabled rows stay disabled.
  This pass re-executed the same semantics in-probe (probes
  B:semantic-pull-captures-names, B:semantic-pull-disabled-all,
  B:semantic-verify-count0, B:semantic-relist-restores-2,
  B:semantic-providers-unchanged, B:semantic-ladder-identical,
  B:semantic-routstr-still-candidate, B:semantic-operator-row-stays-off): pull
  captured exactly the three advertised names and disabled all rows, verify
  counted 0, the scoped relist restored exactly 2 of the captured names while
  the operator-disabled row stayed off, `upstream_providers` was row-identical,
  the ladder file was byte-identical, and the routstr provider remained an
  enabled ladder candidate. Static scoping pins: `tests:303` (pull SQL),
  `tests:311` (relist SQL), `tests:336` (verify payload read-only).

Gaps (**LOW**, non-blocking, all re-measured):

- (**LOW**) (a) `--ssh-target` / `--container` (`routstr_delist.py:536`,
  `routstr_delist.py:537`) are unvalidated — an operator can point the mutating
  payload at another host/container by design. Because the value is a standalone
  argv element with no local shell (probes B:ssh-argv-len3 /
  B:hostile-round-trips), this is a
  target-redirection / option-injection surface, **not** command injection.
- (**LOW**) (b) The payloads hard-code `/app/data/keys.db` ×4
  (`routstr_delist.py:370`, `routstr_delist.py:385`, `routstr_delist.py:393`,
  `routstr_delist.py:407`) — a container layout
  change would mutate whatever DB lives at that path.
- (**LOW**) (c) `save_state`'s return value is ignored at all eight call sites
  (`routstr_delist.py:565`, `:622`, `:629`, `:638`, `:654`, `:710`, `:732`,
  `:752`) — a failed write after a
  CONFIRMED delist (`routstr_delist.py:752`) would silently diverge local state
  from remote reality (cross-ref finding 4).

---

## Finding 2 — Confirmation: delist success is gated on an independent read-only re-fetch

severity: **OK** — requirement MET; residual **MEDIUM** ×1, **LOW** ×2

- **The confirmation mechanism.** `verify_pull_payload()` (`routstr_delist.py:400-411`)
  is a read-only `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM models WHERE enabled=1`
  (`routstr_delist.py:408`) with no UPDATE anywhere (probes B:verify-read-only /
  B:semantic-verify-count0). It runs as a SEPARATE ssh round-trip via
  `_SshBackend.verify` (`routstr_delist.py:790-793`), invoked at
  `routstr_delist.py:682` after the pull inside the attempt loop
  (`routstr_delist.py:671-697`). Success requires
  `vres.get("ok") is True and vres.get("count") == 0` (`routstr_delist.py:683`);
  only then is the flag set (`routstr_delist.py:687`) and the durable
  `delisted=true` written (`routstr_delist.py:747-752`, rc 0 at
  `routstr_delist.py:764`).
- **The happy path is exactly one pull + one verify.** Probes C:happy-rc0,
  C:happy-action-delist, C:happy-confirmed, C:happy-verified-count0,
  C:happy-kinds, C:happy-durable-delisted: rc 0, `action delist`,
  `confirmed true`, `verified_count 0`, executed kinds `["pull","verify"]`,
  durable `delisted=true`; pinned `tests:567` (`test_verify_gates_success`).
- **A lying pull is refuted.** Probes C:lying-rc1 / C:lying-action /
  C:lying-kinds / C:lying-no-flag / C:lying-breaker-tick: a pull that
  self-reports ok while the re-fetch still counts advertised models is forced to
  failure (`routstr_delist.py:691-694`), retried once in-run
  (`MAX_PULL_ATTEMPTS = 2`, `routstr_delist.py:75`), and on exhaustion takes the
  failure branch (`routstr_delist.py:719-739`: `delisted` stays false at
  `routstr_delist.py:726`, baseline not consumed, breaker tick, rc 1/3 at
  `routstr_delist.py:739`). Measured: rc 1, `action delist_failed`, kinds
  `["pull","verify","pull","verify"]`, `consecutive_failures == 1`. Pinned
  `contract:346` (`test_unverified_pull_is_a_failed_delist`), `tests:603`
  (`test_verify_failure_is_attempt_failure`).
- **Parse/transport robustness fails safe.** `_SshBackend._run`
  (`routstr_delist.py:795-825`) accepts only
  `proc.returncode == 0 and data.get("ok") is True` (`routstr_delist.py:822`)
  after parsing the LAST stdout line as JSON (`routstr_delist.py:814`), so a
  non-zero rc, unparseable stdout, or a missing `ok`/`count` key yields a
  non-confirming result — garbage can only fail the run, never confirm it
  (pinned `tests:1107`, `tests:1116`, `tests:1123`, `tests:1146`).

- (**MEDIUM**) **The relist path has no symmetric re-fetch** (re-measured this
  pass, probes C:relist-rc0 / C:relist-no-verify-roundtrip /
  C:relist-gated-on-selfreport / C:relist-clears-flag / C:relist-pops-names).
  Relist success is gated on the round-trip self-report alone
  (`routstr_delist.py:626`), and on that self-report the run sets
  `delisted=false` and pops `pulled_models`
  (`routstr_delist.py:634`, `routstr_delist.py:635`). Measured: a relist executes
  `kinds == ["relist"]` only — **no verify round-trip** — yet clears the flag and
  destroys the stored scoped name set. A lying relist (rc 0, ok printed, UPDATE
  not landed — the same fault class the contract deemed must-fix for delist)
  would therefore fake a restored listing AND destroy the scoped names, forcing a
  subsequent scoped `--relist` to be refused (`routstr_delist.py:600`,
  `routstr_delist.py:606`) and recovery through `--relist-any`, which re-enables
  rows the operator had deliberately disabled (`docs:29`). The contract mandates
  the re-fetch only for "a fired delist" (`docs:69`, `docs:71`), so this is an
  asymmetry, not a contract breach; the fix is cheap (verify `COUNT(*)>0`, or
  re-read the names before popping).
- (**LOW**) (a) dry-run sets the local `confirmed` flag with no remote verify
  (`routstr_delist.py:680`) — intent-only, nothing remote to confirm
  (`docs:87`; probe D:firing-dryrun-pull-only confirms the dry-run delist
  executes `["pull"]` only, with no `verify` round-trip).
- (**LOW**) (b) the verify round-trip shares the ssh transport and last-line JSON
  parsing with the pull (`routstr_delist.py:810`, `routstr_delist.py:814`,
  `routstr_delist.py:822`), so a systematic transport-level fault could satisfy
  both — the failure direction remains safe (a fooled verify only keeps the run
  failing toward the breaker).

---

## Finding 3 — Fail-safe: absent, garbage, and stale monitor feed

severity: **OK** — residual **MEDIUM** ×1, **LOW** ×4

Every branch that can reach a delist runs through
`fire = args.delist or dec["fire"]` (`routstr_delist.py:649`). Enumerated and
probed:

- **Absence — OK.** No `--preds` → `raw_preds=[]`; acceleration requires
  non-empty preds on both sides (`routstr_delist.py:107`), variance requires
  non-empty preds (`routstr_delist.py:143`); a first run with no baseline can
  never fire acceleration (pinned `tests:176`, `contract:308`). Manual
  override remains available by design (`routstr_delist.py:580`).
- **Garbage — OK.** `_read_preds` never raises, drops non-dict entries
  (`routstr_delist.py:479`) and returns `[]` on any parse failure
  (`routstr_delist.py:481`, `routstr_delist.py:482`). Probes D:garbage-read-preds-empty /
  D:garbage-none-empty / D:garbage-drops-nondict / D:garbage-rc1 /
  D:garbage-preds-error / D:garbage-action-none / D:garbage-no-remote /
  D:garbage-baseline-intact
  (driven through `main()`): a malformed feed → rc 1, `preds_error=true`
  (computed at `routstr_delist.py:585`), `action none`, no remote action, and the
  stored baseline `{"zai\x1f1h": 12.0}` intact (`update_state` only overwrites
  the snapshot when preds is non-empty, `routstr_delist.py:261`,
  `routstr_delist.py:262`; pinned `tests:243`, `tests:547`). Type guards:
  `uncertainty` is isinstance-guarded with bool explicitly excluded
  (`routstr_delist.py:152`; pinned `tests:146`), and
  `exhausts_in_hours` is guarded (`routstr_delist.py:193`,
  `routstr_delist.py:196`).
- **Stale — OK.** `STALENESS_S = 1800` (`routstr_delist.py:78`); `feed_is_stale`
  (`routstr_delist.py:485-496`) is mtime-based and fails closed — undeterminable
  age (`OSError`) returns True (`routstr_delist.py:495`,
  `routstr_delist.py:496`), and the age expression
  `not (0 <= age <= max_age_s)` (`routstr_delist.py:494`) makes a future mtime
  stale. Probes D:stale-fresh-false, D:stale-boundary-inclusive-false (clock
  injected via the `now=` kwarg: **exact boundary 1800 s → False, inclusive**),
  D:stale-1801-true, D:stale-future-mtime-true, D:stale-missing-path-true.
  Wiring: a stale feed zeroes the preds before trigger
  evaluation (`routstr_delist.py:589`, `routstr_delist.py:591`,
  `routstr_delist.py:592`), so even the level-based variance trigger cannot fire
  on dead data, and before any baseline refresh. Probes D:stale-rc1 /
  D:stale-flag / D:stale-action-none / D:stale-no-remote / D:stale-baseline-intact:
  variance-elevated (0.99) but 2 h-old feed → rc 1, `action none`,
  `preds_stale=true`, zero remote calls, baseline intact; pinned `tests:937`,
  `tests:968`, `tests:995`.
  `preds_stale` is surfaced in every output branch (`routstr_delist.py:656`,
  `:714`, `:735`, `:762`) with rc 1 when quiet (`routstr_delist.py:660`). The
  manual override is deliberately never gated on freshness
  (`routstr_delist.py:580` ordering; probes D:manual-not-gated-rc0 /
  D:manual-stale-observed → rc 0, `preds_stale=true`; pinned `tests:980`,
  `docs:60`).
- **Breaker interaction (cross-ref finding 6).** Repeated failed runs refuse all
  further remote action (`routstr_delist.py:724`, `:727`, `:731`; refuse-all at
  `routstr_delist.py:569`, exit 3 at `routstr_delist.py:578`) until `--unblock`
  (`routstr_delist.py:561`, `routstr_delist.py:567`); a dry run never counts
  toward it (`routstr_delist.py:699`).

- (**MEDIUM**) **dry-run purity is conditional on firing** (re-measured this
  pass, probes D:quiet-dryrun-rc0 / D:quiet-dryrun-refreshes-baseline /
  D:quiet-dryrun-no-last-run). `docs:87` and the firing path
  (`routstr_delist.py:699-717`) promise a dry run consumes no acceleration
  baseline and records `last_dry_run`. The QUIET branch
  (`routstr_delist.py:651`, `routstr_delist.py:652`, `routstr_delist.py:654`)
  has **no** `--dry-run` guard: passing `--dry-run` with a quiet (11 h)
  feed against a 12 h baseline → rc 0, and the stored snapshot is refreshed from
  12.0 to 11.0 with **no** `last_dry_run` recorded — the dry run silently
  perturbed durable state and left no trace. The contrast is exact: the
  *firing* dry run records `last_dry_run` (`routstr_delist.py:705`), sets no
  durable delist flag and runs `pull` only (probes
  D:firing-dryrun-records-intent, D:firing-dryrun-pull-only,
  D:firing-dryrun-no-flag). Impact is loss of protection (a baseline can move
  under a "no side effects" run), never an unsafe delist.
- (**LOW**) (a) `--preds-key` scoping is opt-in and defaults UNSCOPED — filtering
  happens only when the flag is passed (`routstr_delist.py:594`,
  `routstr_delist.py:597`), and `evaluate_triggers` passes no `key` to
  `variance_jumped` (`routstr_delist.py:303`) although the parameter exists for
  that purpose. Probes D:unscoped-default-fires / D:scoped-filter-quiets drive
  `main()` with a foreign `openrouter` variance spike: with no `--preds-key` the
  foreign spike fires the delist, while the filter quiets it when the key is
  given; pinned `tests:776`, documented at `docs:54`–`docs:55`.
- (**LOW**) (b) mtime-only freshness (`routstr_delist.py:485`,
  `routstr_delist.py:494`): a writer that rewrites `preds.json` with old data
  refreshes the mtime and bypasses the guard.
- (**LOW**) (c) Cosmetic: `_hours` accepts bool (`routstr_delist.py:193`,
  `routstr_delist.py:196`) while the variance guard excludes it
  (`routstr_delist.py:152`) — arithmetic-safe; the override marker is
  presence-based with no TTL (`routstr_delist.py:164`,
  `routstr_delist.py:172`), operator-controlled by design.
- (**LOW**) (d) Cross-ref finding 4: the quiet-run state write
  (`routstr_delist.py:654`) ignores the `save_state` return value.
